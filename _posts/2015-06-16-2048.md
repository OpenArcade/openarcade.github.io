2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli,
in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

This version is a remake made by [Brandon Poe](http://brandonpoe.com) with a goal of being responsive, and both
mobile and desktop friendly.
