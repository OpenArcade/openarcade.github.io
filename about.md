##Hello and welcome to Open Arcade!

The goal here is first an foremost to create an ad free environment where you can enjoy all of your favorite games on
all (most) of you favorite platforms. The secondary goal is that you would enjoy these games so much that it would prompt
you to crack open the source code and see how the gears turn. Hopefully you’ll see that it really quite simple.
The least important (but for me, the most rewarding) goal is that you would show your appreciation of the hard work of
others and contribute to the platform. Whether that be adding to and existing game or bringing a whole new game to the table.

I love creating things and I love sharing the things I’ve created with others. My hope is that the spirit of this site
may rub off on others and encourage everyone to share their abilities with others freely. Most of the projects are MIT,
but some are licensed under GNU. Feel free to fork these projects and use as you wish, but be mindful that derivatives
of GNU projects must remain as such.
